# RouteNet - Graph Neural Networking challenge 2020

#### Organized as part of "ITU AI/ML in 5G challenge"

Challenge website: https://bnn.upc.edu/challenge2020

[RouteNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08113)
is a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that was proposed as a cost-effective alternative to estimate per-source-destination performance metrics (e.g., delay, jitter, loss) in networks. 
Thanks to its GNN architecture that operates over graph-structured data, RouteNet revealed an unprecedented ability to learn and model the complex relationships among topology, routing and input traffic in networks. As a result, it was able to make performance predictions with similar accuracy than resource-hungry packet-level simulators even in network scenarios unseen during training.
This provides network operators with a functional tool able to make accurate predictions of end-to-end Key Performance Indicators (e.g., delay, jitter, loss).

## Quick Start
### Requirements
We strongly recommend use Python 3.7, since lower versions of Python may cause problems to define all the PATH environment variables.
The following packages are required:
* Tensorflow == 2.1.0. You can install it following the official [Tensorflow 2 installation guide.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
* NetworkX >= 2.4. You can install it using *pip* following the official [NetworkX installation guide.](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html)
* Pandas >= 0.24. You can install it using *pip* following the official [Pandas installation guide.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)

### Testing the installation
In order to test the installation, we provide a toy dataset that contains some random samples. You can simply verify your installation by executing the [main.py](/code/main.py) file.
```
python main.py
```

You should see something like this:
```
INFO:tensorflow:loss = 11.47464, step = 0
INFO:tensorflow:Loss = 11.47464, Regularization loss = 2.236953, Total loss = 13.711593
INFO:tensorflow:Loss = 0.5757023, Regularization loss = 2.1888266, Total loss = 2.7645288 (8.679 sec)
INFO:tensorflow:Loss = 0.52902216, Regularization loss = 2.1290224, Total loss = 2.6580446 (2.415 sec)
INFO:tensorflow:Loss = 9.057413, Regularization loss = 2.0658476, Total loss = 11.1232605 (2.877 sec)
INFO:tensorflow:Loss = 2.2091186, Regularization loss = 2.0054069, Total loss = 4.214525 (2.785 sec)
INFO:tensorflow:Loss = 0.19975021, Regularization loss = 1.9461617, Total loss = 2.145912 (2.593 sec)
INFO:tensorflow:Loss = 0.25079936, Regularization loss = 1.8887523, Total loss = 2.1395516 (2.724 sec)
```

### Training, evaluation and prediction
We provide two methods, one for training and evaluation and one for prediction. These methods can be found in the [main.py](/code/main.py) file.

#### Training and evaluation
The method for training and evaluation can be found in the [main.py](/code/main.py) file and it is called [train_and_evaluate](/code/main.py#L29). This method trains during a max number of steps and evaluates every number of seconds. 
It also automatically saves the trained model in a directory every time step.

<ins>**IMPORTANT NOTE:**</ins> The execution can be stopped and resumed at any time. However, **if you want to start a new training phase you need to create a new directory (or empty the previous one)**. If you are only doing tests, you can simply pass *model_dir*=None. This will create a temporary directory that will be removed at the end of the execution.

Note that all the parameters needed for the execution (max number of steps, time between model saving...) can be changed in the [[RUN_CONFIG]](code/config.ini#L29) section within the [config.ini](code/config.ini) file.

#### Prediction
In order to make predictions with the trained model, the method [predict](/code/main.py#L66) is provided. This method takes as input the path to the trained model and returns an array with the predictions.
Another method called [predict_and_save](/code/main.py#L90) can also be used in order to make the predictions. In this case, the real and the predicted delays are saved in a CSV file in order to make the visualization of the errors in an easier way. This function returns the Mean Relative Error used for the evaluation. 

## 'How to' guide to modify the code
### Transforming the input data
Now, the model reads the data as it is in the datasets. However, it is often highly recommended to apply some transformations (e.g. normalization, standardization, etc.) to the data in order to facilitate the model to converge during training.
In the [dataset.py](code/read_dataset.py) module you can find a function called [transformation(x, y)](code/read_dataset.py#L125), where the X variable represents the predictors used by the model and the Y variable the target values.
For example, if you want to apply a Min-Max scaling over the 'bandwith' variable, you can use the following code:
```
def transformation(x, y):
    x['bandwith']=(x['bandwith']-bandwith_min)/(bandwith_max-bandwith_min)
    return x, y
```
Where 'bandwith_min' and 'bandwith_max' are respectively the minimum and maximum bandwith values obtained from the dataset.

### Adding new features to the hidden states
Currently, the model only considers the 'bandwith' variable to initialize the initial state of paths.
If we take a look into the [model.py](code/routenet_model.py) module, we can see how the [state initialization](code/routenet_model.py#L91) is done:
```
# Compute the shape for the all-zero tensor for path_state
shape = tf.stack([
    f_['n_paths'],
    int(self.config['HYPERPARAMETERS']['path_state_dim']) - 1
], axis=0)

# Initialize the initial hidden state for paths
path_state = tf.concat([
    tf.expand_dims(f_['bandwith'], axis=1),
    tf.zeros(shape)
], axis=1)
```
For example, if you also want to add the packets transmitted to the paths' initial states, you can easily do so by changing the code to:
```
shape = tf.stack([
    f_['n_paths'],
    int(self.config['HYPERPARAMETERS']['path_state_dim']) - 2
], axis=0)

path_state = tf.concat([
    tf.expand_dims(f_['bandwith'], axis=1),
    tf.expand_dims(f_['packets'], axis=1),
    tf.zeros(shape)
], axis=1)
```
Note that two changes are needed here. First, you need to change the *shape* variable. This is a tensor used to pad the initial states with zeros. The *CONFIG['HYPERPARAMETERS']['path_state_dim']* variable defines the size of the path state. Since we are adding a new array of one dimension (i.e., f_['packets']), we need to subtract one to the size of the *shape* variable (i.e., self.config['HYPERPARAMETERS']['path_state_dim']) **- 2**).
Second, you need to add the variable (i.e., f_['packets']) into the path state.

### Available features
In the previous example we could directly include the packets transmitted (i.e., f_['packets']) into the paths’ hidden states. This is because this implementation provides some dataset features that are already processed from the dataset and converted into tensors. Particularly, these tensors are then used to fill a [TensorFlow Dataset structure]( https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.1/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset). This can be found in the [read_data.py](/code/read_dataset.py#L175) file, where the following features are included:
* 'bandwidth': This tensor represents the bitrate (bits/time unit) of all the src-dst paths (This is obtained from the traffic_matrix[src,dst][′Flows′][′0′][‘AvgBw’] values of all src-dst pairs using the [DataNet API]((https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/datanetAPI/tree/challenge2020)))
* 'packets': This tensor represents the rate of packets generated (packets/time unit) of all the src-dst paths (This is obtained from the traffic_matrix[src,dst][′Flows′][′0′][‘PktsGen’] values of all src-dst pairs using the [DataNet API]((https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/datanetAPI/tree/challenge2020)))
* 'link_capacity': This tensor represents the link capacity (bits/time unit) of all the links found on the network (This is obtained from the topology_object[node][adj][0]['bandwidth'] values of all node-adj pairs using the [DataNet API]((https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/datanetAPI/tree/challenge2020)))
* 'links': This tensor is used to define the message passing in the GNN. Particularly, it uses sequences of link IDs to define the message passing from links to paths.
* 'paths': This tensor is also used in the message passing. Particularly, it uses sequences of path IDs to define the message passing from paths to links.
* 'sequences': This tensor is also used in the message passing. Particularly, it is an auxiliary tensor used to define the order of links in each path.
* 'n_links': This variable represents the number of links in the topology. 
* 'n_paths': This variable represents the total number of src-dst paths in the network.

Note that there are additional features in our datasets that are not included in this TensorFlow Data structure. However, they can be included processing the data with the dataset API and converting it into tensors. For this, you need to modify the [generator()](/code/read_dataset.py#L24) and [input_fn()](/code/read_dataset.py#L138) functions in the [read_dataset.py](/code/read_dataset.py) file. Please, refer to the [API documentation](https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/datanetAPI/tree/challenge2020) of the datasets to see more details about all the data included in our datasets.

**Note:** For the challenge, consider that variables under the *performance_matrix* of sample objects (see [API documentation](https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/datanetAPI/tree/challenge2020)) cannot be used as inputs of the model, since they will not be available in the final test set.

Also, note that this RouteNet implementation assumes there is only a flow per path. However, it could be easily extensible to suport multiple flows on every src-dst pair.

### Hyperparameter tunning
If you also want to modify or even add new hyperparameters, you can do so by modifying the [[HYPERPARAMETERS]](code/config.ini#L9) section in the [config.ini](code/config.ini) file.
